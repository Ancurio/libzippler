What is Zippler?
----------------

Zippler is a GObject based convenience
library written in Vala for browsing and
accessing the contents of zip files.
Built on top of the popular minizip
code which comes bundled with zlib,
it provides a neat interface which
presents a zipfile as a tree of folders
and files, much like a filesystem.

Example: list all files/folders in
the root directory of a zip-file:

	var zip = new Zippler.Archive();
	zip.load_file("myZipFile.zip");
	
	foreach (Zippler.Entry e in zip.root_entry.get_children())
		stdout.printf("%s\n", e.name);
				

The example file ZipplerView showcases
a simple GTK-based zip file browser
in about 140 lines.
